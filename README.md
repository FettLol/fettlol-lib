# Fettlol Library

> Note: This is very much still a **Work in Progress** and will most likely not be useful to anybody.

Long-term ambitions for this project is to create a library that the various `fettlol` mods will use. This will allow
us to put all the heavy lifting and repeated code segments in here, focusing the actual mods on their core functionality
rather than just rewriting the same kinds of things over and over.

As indicated, this is still very much a work in progress, and I am currently migrating all kinds of wrappers and utility
from `fettlol-utilmod` into this package, after which I will be able to start adding more new things to it.

# DISCLAIMER

This is not guaranteed to do anything, whether good nor bad, and can have all kinds of weird side effects. Use at your
own risk. Warnings aside, feel free to read, be inspired by and post pull requests to the repo; I'm always happy to see
my code being read and reused elsewhere.
